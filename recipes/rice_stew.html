        <img src ="C:\Users\Ordi-for-code\Pictures\food3.jfif">
        <p>One form would entail preparing your 
            white rice and making your beef, chicken or 
            fish stew and topping it with vegetable sauce, also called 
            vegetable stew in some parts of Nigeria. 
            The second form of this meal entails preparing 
            your white rice as usual and making a vegetable stew.
             That's cooking your tomato stew with vegetables as an ingredient.

                <li>Onions</li>

            </ul>
            <ol>Preparation Steps
                <li>Parboil your rice for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Wash the rice and put it back on fire with adequate water added.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste</li>
                <li>Blend your tomatoes, alongside some of the fresh pepper and onions you have and put it on fire.</li>
                <li>Steam the tomato mixture until the excess water is dried up.</li>
                <li>Chop the remaining onions and blend the few fresh peppers you have left.</li>
                <li>Prepare the meat by adding seasoning to your beef (in a pot) and boiling till it becomes soft. Ensure it has some sauce left for the stew.</li>
                <li>Open 2 or 3 sachets of tomato paste and pour it into the pot</li>
                <li>Stir the mixture and allow it to cook for 4-5 minutes.
                    Stir the mixture to ensure the tomato mixture doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Pour in your meat alongside the sauce and allow it to cook for some time.
                    Add your salt, the ground fresh pepper and seasoning to taste.
                    Allow the mixture to boil for some time, and there you have your beef </li>
